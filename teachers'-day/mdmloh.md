dear mdm loh,
thankyou for teaching us so many new things this year! we didn't only learn science from you, but also life lessons, or even tips to deal with our love life !
thankyou for bringing us to the lab as many times as possible because you know we like having lessons there
also, thankyou so much for making all your lessons the most entertaining ones !!
we really appreciate the amount of effort you put in to make us love and get excited to learn science
when we need help with any topics, you always ask us to ask you questions when we don't understand any particular topics
when we have questions, we will be abe to find you for consultation and you will go through diffeent questions linked to that topic in order to make sure that we fully understand the topic and know how to answer questions correctly
you also find extra papers to give us for revisiom for us to revise for exams
most importantly, during class when we look stressed, you will teach us life lessons that life as a student is not always about studying, and we would need to take breaks
you will even show us videos that you think are inspirational so that we will learn life lessons
thank you so much for evrything and i hope you'll have a great teachers' day !!
